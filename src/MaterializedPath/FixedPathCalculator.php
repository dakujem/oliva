/**
 * A calculus for fixed-length materialized path trees.
 *
 * It can be used to transform paths to vectors and vice versa.
 *
 * Note ðŸ’¡:
 *   This calculator is OPINIONATED and assumes a trivial MPT
 *   where sibling enumerators (sequence numbers) are used to describe a node's position within the tree.
 *
 *
 * The most important setting is the number of characters to store a single position within a path,
 * a.k.a. the level width.
 *
 * Recommended values: 3 and above.
 * - 3 characters means a maximum of    46_656 siblings per node (36^3)
 * - 4 characters means a maximum of 1_679_616 siblings per node (36^4)
 * - 5 characters ~ over 60 million nodes (36^5)
 * - 6 characters ~ over  2 billion nodes (36^6)
 *
 * The number of levels is not limited in theory, but in practice it will be limited by storage restrictions, like column width.
 * Higher number means that each node can have more children, but takes up more space.
 *
 * If IDs are going to be used in the paths, then the length must be used accordingly.
 * In such a case the delimited variant may be a better choice.
 * But remember that the delimited variant either requires a storage that supports natural sort (MySQL/MariaDB do not)
 * and a more convoluted sorting conditions using splits, or requires the use of a second column to store sequence/priority.
